#Joomla site theme

Hi, this project is just to hold the stylesheets and a few other small, usually javascript, files for the templates that we are using on the NUCA site, which as you may have gathered is based on Joomla.

Obviously all of this could be obtained from the website anyway, hence my putting it here in a public repository, if anyone does want (unlikely though that seems) they are free to branch it for themselves.
